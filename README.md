# MeseMe - the 48 hour APP
Decent Messenger app with both client / server implementation, and GUI / console UI.

-----
## Self-made 48h Hackaton
This application was made in a self-driven hackaton of aprox ~48 hours.

## Technologies:
1. Client server app / TCP sockets
2. WPF for GUI / Prism / DI
3. Console runner for both client and server

## Self-acknowledgement
I know, I know, there aren't any tests. I didn't have enough time for those. :|

## Conclusions:
Even though it was a hackaton, the overall architecture is quite pleasing, and with a bit of a cleaning this can be further refined into something great. :)
